## Project Motivation
Mental health issues are on rise all over the world. Since we spend most of our day at our workplace, it is a key location for the improvement of the well-being of adults. The wellness programs at the workplace can identify those at risk and connect them to treatment and put in place supports to help people reduce and manage stress. 
This project analyses the current trends and attitude of the employers towards the mental health. It also presents the classifier models to identify how likely it is that an employee will seek the treatment for the mental health issues.

## Summary of the results
- Although most employers provide mental health benefits, still there is a large percentage of employers who either don't provide or about whom employees don't even know about.
- Most of the employers don't even discuss the employee wellness program indicating it's minimal importance to them.
- It seems that mental health interferes with work sometimes and not that often. It is also worth noting that many of them don't know if it is affecting their work.
- Employees are least likely to discuss mental health problems with their employers. Although they are okay with discussing them to their supervisor as well as coworkers.
- Transgenders with a family history of mental issues seem to be most affected by mental health issues.
- Mostly Transgender in the age group 21–30, as well as other groups, are facing mental health issues in the workplace. There seems to be an outlier in the age range 66–100 for females with probability 1.
